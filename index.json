    "keywords": "Advanced value Lookup (Command Line) Component basics If the field values contain special characters, it could potentially cause issues using Advanced value lookup so avoid having special characters in your field values. Title Command Line Description To enter a special command line that can collect values using more complex lookups than the normal setup. Specifications Title | Command Line | ----------- | ----------- | | Usage | To refer to the Record ID of the current record in the command line you use “This”. Example: to get item translation from a Sales Invoice Line Table 111 record: GetFieldValue(LookupRecord(This,30,'6,5402','1,5400','Field2=1(%1)',GetFieldValue(LookupRecord(This,110,'3','3','',''),41)),3) Example: to get item translation from a Purchase Line Table 39 record: GetFieldValue(LookupRecord(This,30,'6,5402','1,5400','Field2=1(%1)',GetFieldValue(LookupRecord(This,38,'3','3','',''),41)),3) Title Command Line Simple Explanation “This” is like saying “the book I’m holding right now”. It refers to the current record (or ‘book’) you’re working with. GetFieldValue is like asking “what’s written on page 41 of this book?”. It gets the value of a specific field (or ‘page’) from a record (or ‘book’). LookupRecord is like saying “find me another book that has a connection to the book I’m holding”. It finds a related record (or ‘book’) based on certain criteria. Here are the steps it follows: It first identifies the ‘parent’ record (the book you’re holding). It then looks at a specific table (a particular section of the library). It uses certain fields from the parent record and the lookup table to find a match (like matching the author and title of the book). It also uses a table view expression and values, which are like additional criteria for finding the book (like the color of the book cover or the year it was published). Variations Procedures have been added to \"SCB Report Content\" Table 6082805 and a command Line field has been added to \"SCB Ext. Description fields\" Table 6082806. The field is used to enter a special command line that can collect values using more complex lookups than the normal setup. The command line uses two methods: LookupRecord and GetFieldValue: LookupRecord Looks up a record in some table based on the Parent Record. Uses 6 parameters: ParentRecIDText : Text[1024]; //RecordID for the parent record as text LookupTableID : Integer; //ID of the table from which you want to get a record ParentLinkFields : Text[1024]; //List of parent field numbers used for link LookupTableLinkFields : Text[1024]; //List of lookup table field numbers used for link LookupTableViewExpression : Text[1024]; //Table view expression using ‘%1’, ‘%2’…etc for values LookupTableViewValues : Text[1024]) : //List of values to be used in table view expression Returns Record ID as text for the looked up record Text[1024] GetFieldValue Gets a field value from a record based on a Record ID and a field number. Uses 2 parameters: RecIDText : Text[1024]; //RecordID for the record as text FieldNo : Integer //Field number Returns value as text. (Text[1024])"

    "keywords": "Advanced value Lookup (Command Line) Component basics If the field values contain special characters, it could potentially cause issues using Advanced value lookup so avoid having special characters in your field values. Title Command Line Description To enter a special command line that can collect values using more complex lookups than the normal setup. Specifications Title | Command Line | ----------- | ----------- | | Usage | To refer to the Record ID of the current record in the command line you use “This”. Example: to get item translation from a Sales Invoice Line Table 111 record: GetFieldValue(LookupRecord(This,30,'6,5402','1,5400','Field2=1(%1)',GetFieldValue(LookupRecord(This,110,'3','3','',''),41)),3) Example: to get item translation from a Purchase Line Table 39 record: GetFieldValue(LookupRecord(This,30,'6,5402','1,5400','Field2=1(%1)',GetFieldValue(LookupRecord(This,38,'3','3','',''),41)),3) Title Command Line Simple Explanation “This” is like saying “the book I’m holding right now”. It refers to the current record (or ‘book’) you’re working with. GetFieldValue is like asking “what’s written on page 41 of this book?”. It gets the value of a specific field (or ‘page’) from a record (or ‘book’). LookupRecord is like saying “find me another book that has a connection to the book I’m holding”. It finds a related record (or ‘book’) based on certain criteria. Here are the steps it follows: It first identifies the ‘parent’ record (the book you’re holding). It then looks at a specific table (a particular section of the library). It uses certain fields from the parent record and the lookup table to find a match (like matching the author and title of the book). It also uses a table view expression and values, which are like additional criteria for finding the book (like the color of the book cover or the year it was published). Variations Procedures have been added to \"SCB Report Content\" Table 6082805 and a command Line field has been added to \"SCB Ext. Description fields\" Table 6082806. The field is used to enter a special command line that can collect values using more complex lookups than the normal setup. The command line uses two methods: LookupRecord and GetFieldValue: LookupRecord Looks up a record in some table based on the Parent Record. Uses 6 parameters: ParentRecIDText : Text[1024]; //RecordID for the parent record as text LookupTableID : Integer; //ID of the table from which you want to get a record ParentLinkFields : Text[1024]; //List of parent field numbers used for link LookupTableLinkFields : Text[1024]; //List of lookup table field numbers used for link LookupTableViewExpression : Text[1024]; //Table view expression using ‘%1’, ‘%2’…etc for values LookupTableViewValues : Text[1024]) : //List of values to be used in table view expression Returns Record ID as text for the looked up record Text[1024] GetFieldValue Gets a field value from a record based on a Record ID and a field number. Uses 2 parameters: RecIDText : Text[1024]; //RecordID for the record as text FieldNo : Integer //Field number Returns value as text. (Text[1024])"

    "keywords": "Advanced value Lookup (Command Line) Component basics If the field values contain special characters, it could potentially cause issues using Advanced value lookup so avoid having special characters in your field values. Title Command Line Description To enter a special command line that can collect values using more complex lookups than the normal setup. Specifications Title | Command Line | ----------- | ----------- | | Usage | To refer to the Record ID of the current record in the command line you use “This”. Example: to get item translation from a Sales Invoice Line Table 111 record: GetFieldValue(LookupRecord(This,30,'6,5402','1,5400','Field2=1(%1)',GetFieldValue(LookupRecord(This,110,'3','3','',''),41)),3) Example: to get item translation from a Purchase Line Table 39 record: GetFieldValue(LookupRecord(This,30,'6,5402','1,5400','Field2=1(%1)',GetFieldValue(LookupRecord(This,38,'3','3','',''),41)),3) Title Command Line Simple Explanation “This” is like saying “the book I’m holding right now”. It refers to the current record (or ‘book’) you’re working with. GetFieldValue is like asking “what’s written on page 41 of this book?”. It gets the value of a specific field (or ‘page’) from a record (or ‘book’). LookupRecord is like saying “find me another book that has a connection to the book I’m holding”. It finds a related record (or ‘book’) based on certain criteria. Here are the steps it follows: It first identifies the ‘parent’ record (the book you’re holding). It then looks at a specific table (a particular section of the library). It uses certain fields from the parent record and the lookup table to find a match (like matching the author and title of the book). It also uses a table view expression and values, which are like additional criteria for finding the book (like the color of the book cover or the year it was published). Variations Procedures have been added to \"SCB Report Content\" Table 6082805 and a command Line field has been added to \"SCB Ext. Description fields\" Table 6082806. The field is used to enter a special command line that can collect values using more complex lookups than the normal setup. The command line uses two methods: LookupRecord and GetFieldValue: LookupRecord Looks up a record in some table based on the Parent Record. Uses 6 parameters: ParentRecIDText : Text[1024]; //RecordID for the parent record as text LookupTableID : Integer; //ID of the table from which you want to get a record ParentLinkFields : Text[1024]; //List of parent field numbers used for link LookupTableLinkFields : Text[1024]; //List of lookup table field numbers used for link LookupTableViewExpression : Text[1024]; //Table view expression using ‘%1’, ‘%2’…etc for values LookupTableViewValues : Text[1024]) : //List of values to be used in table view expression Returns Record ID as text for the looked up record Text[1024] GetFieldValue Gets a field value from a record based on a Record ID and a field number. Uses 2 parameters: RecIDText : Text[1024]; //RecordID for the record as text FieldNo : Integer //Field number Returns value as text. (Text[1024])"

Your Master Data Needs Businesses may have many Master Data registration needs, like measurements, colors, pictures, documents, web shop data, etc. These Master Data must be easy to save, search for, bulk update, and overview. Benefits Use the Master Data Information app on the Item card to create additional attributes to manage information like measurements, colors, quantities per unit, web shop information, etc. This is classic Product Information Management (PIM). You may also add Master Data attributes to other tables like Customers, Vendors, Bill of Materials, Batch/Lot Numbers, Service Items, Serial Numbers, etc. This app is completely non-invasive, meaning it will not conflict with other data in your Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central solution. You simply create new custom fields as attributes yourself. Key Benefits Include: Create new attributes and data structures without custom extensions. Use extended text fields without limitations to the field length. Bulk update multiple item records, i.e., from lists from suppliers. Create new items from item templates. Search for records on any of the master data attributes. Add information to invoices without report changes. Standardize item data across all departments. Centralize management of web shop item data with HTML-formatted data. Include files, images, user guides, and any rich media in master data. Create your own data views with data from several tabs and several records. Make changes to master data in Excel and submit the changes back into the system. In short: Master Data Information is the simple way to manage your Master Data in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. It enables you to extend tables with new data fields for any data registration need you may have. Getting Started To help you get started with Master Data Information, we have 147 tutorial videos available on Use Dynamics. You will find similar collections of instructional videos for most of the Abakion Apps. Use Dynamics is your comprehensive learning portal for both Business Central and Abakion Apps."

    "keywords": "Advanced value Lookup (Command Line) Component basics If the field values contain special characters, it could potentially cause issues using Advanced value lookup so avoid having special characters in your field values. Title Command Line Description To enter a special command line that can collect values using more complex lookups than the normal setup. Specifications Title | Command Line | ----------- | ----------- | | Usage | To refer to the Record ID of the current record in the command line you use “This”. Example: to get item translation from a Sales Invoice Line Table 111 record: GetFieldValue(LookupRecord(This,30,'6,5402','1,5400','Field2=1(%1)',GetFieldValue(LookupRecord(This,110,'3','3','',''),41)),3) Example: to get item translation from a Purchase Line Table 39 record: GetFieldValue(LookupRecord(This,30,'6,5402','1,5400','Field2=1(%1)',GetFieldValue(LookupRecord(This,38,'3','3','',''),41)),3) Title Command Line Simple Explanation “This” is like saying “the book I’m holding right now”. It refers to the current record (or ‘book’) you’re working with. GetFieldValue is like asking “what’s written on page 41 of this book?”. It gets the value of a specific field (or ‘page’) from a record (or ‘book’). LookupRecord is like saying “find me another book that has a connection to the book I’m holding”. It finds a related record (or ‘book’) based on certain criteria. Here are the steps it follows: It first identifies the ‘parent’ record (the book you’re holding). It then looks at a specific table (a particular section of the library). It uses certain fields from the parent record and the lookup table to find a match (like matching the author and title of the book). It also uses a table view expression and values, which are like additional criteria for finding the book (like the color of the book cover or the year it was published). Variations Procedures have been added to \"SCB Report Content\" Table 6082805 and a command Line field has been added to \"SCB Ext. Description fields\" Table 6082806. The field is used to enter a special command line that can collect values using more complex lookups than the normal setup. The command line uses two methods: LookupRecord and GetFieldValue: LookupRecord Looks up a record in some table based on the Parent Record. Uses 6 parameters: ParentRecIDText : Text[1024]; //RecordID for the parent record as text LookupTableID : Integer; //ID of the table from which you want to get a record ParentLinkFields : Text[1024]; //List of parent field numbers used for link LookupTableLinkFields : Text[1024]; //List of lookup table field numbers used for link LookupTableViewExpression : Text[1024]; //Table view expression using ‘%1’, ‘%2’…etc for values LookupTableViewValues : Text[1024]) : //List of values to be used in table view expression Returns Record ID as text for the looked up record Text[1024] GetFieldValue Gets a field value from a record based on a Record ID and a field number. Uses 2 parameters: RecIDText : Text[1024]; //RecordID for the record as text FieldNo : Integer //Field number Returns value as text. (Text[1024])"

    "keywords": "Advanced value Lookup (Command Line) Component basics If the field values contain special characters, it could potentially cause issues using Advanced value lookup so avoid having special characters in your field values. Title Command Line Description To enter a special command line that can collect values using more complex lookups than the normal setup. Specifications Title | Command Line | ----------- | ----------- | | Usage | To refer to the Record ID of the current record in the command line you use “This”. Example: to get item translation from a Sales Invoice Line Table 111 record: GetFieldValue(LookupRecord(This,30,'6,5402','1,5400','Field2=1(%1)',GetFieldValue(LookupRecord(This,110,'3','3','',''),41)),3) Example: to get item translation from a Purchase Line Table 39 record: GetFieldValue(LookupRecord(This,30,'6,5402','1,5400','Field2=1(%1)',GetFieldValue(LookupRecord(This,38,'3','3','',''),41)),3) Title Command Line Simple Explanation “This” is like saying “the book I’m holding right now”. It refers to the current record (or ‘book’) you’re working with. GetFieldValue is like asking “what’s written on page 41 of this book?”. It gets the value of a specific field (or ‘page’) from a record (or ‘book’). LookupRecord is like saying “find me another book that has a connection to the book I’m holding”. It finds a related record (or ‘book’) based on certain criteria. Here are the steps it follows: It first identifies the ‘parent’ record (the book you’re holding). It then looks at a specific table (a particular section of the library). It uses certain fields from the parent record and the lookup table to find a match (like matching the author and title of the book). It also uses a table view expression and values, which are like additional criteria for finding the book (like the color of the book cover or the year it was published). Variations Procedures have been added to \"SCB Report Content\" Table 6082805 and a command Line field has been added to \"SCB Ext. Description fields\" Table 6082806. The field is used to enter a special command line that can collect values using more complex lookups than the normal setup. The command line uses two methods: LookupRecord and GetFieldValue: LookupRecord Looks up a record in some table based on the Parent Record. Uses 6 parameters: ParentRecIDText : Text[1024]; //RecordID for the parent record as text LookupTableID : Integer; //ID of the table from which you want to get a record ParentLinkFields : Text[1024]; //List of parent field numbers used for link LookupTableLinkFields : Text[1024]; //List of lookup table field numbers used for link LookupTableViewExpression : Text[1024]; //Table view expression using ‘%1’, ‘%2’…etc for values LookupTableViewValues : Text[1024]) : //List of values to be used in table view expression Returns Record ID as text for the looked up record Text[1024] GetFieldValue Gets a field value from a record based on a Record ID and a field number. Uses 2 parameters: RecIDText : Text[1024]; //RecordID for the record as text FieldNo : Integer //Field number Returns value as text. (Text[1024])"
